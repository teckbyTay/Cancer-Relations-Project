```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
options(dplyr.summarise.inform = FALSE)
```

Getting dataset from R:

```{r}
dat<- esoph
```


First we model our data in order to check if the residuals are normally distributed in order to conduct ANOVA. Out model will be 



```{r}

model <- aov(dat$ncases ~ dat$agegp+dat$alcgp+dat$tobgp, data = dat)

#summary(model)

#plot the model
plot(model)

#looking at histogram of residuals
hist(model2$residuals, main = "Residuals Histogram")


```
  


```{r}
shapiro.test(model$residuals)
```

uhh ohh looks like data is not normually distributed.

trying again but with probabily 

```{r}
esoph$percentage <- esoph$ncases / (esoph$ncontrols+esoph$ncases)

model2 <- aov(percentage ~ agegp + tobgp + alcgp, data = esoph) #Linear model is created in order to apply anova test

plot(model2$residuals)
hist((model2$residuals))


#formal test of normality

shapiro.test(model2$residuals)

#here p-value >.05 so we would not reject the null as there is strong evidence against rejecting the null.


```






Game Plan


#number of cancer cases are normally distributed?







#two way anova/3 way anova

#tukey's test
